BUILD the shell extension
=========================
- If already loaded, cannot link the dll: kill the explorer.exe process from Task Manager.
- Windows 10: run Visual Studio 2008 as administrator:
	- This allows proper registration of the shell extension dll.
	- For proper registration in the final location use "Tools > Copy to Tools/mine/" and "Tools > Register DLL to Tools/mine/" while running as administrator.


DEBUG the shell extension (FileRenameShell64.dll/FileRenameShell32.dll)
=========================
1) Use ExplorerBrowser tool from CodeProject
- this works like a charm for 32/64 bit shell extension.
- it doesn't lock the dll, you can set breakpoints in the code for Debug or Release builds.
	Solution > FileRenShell > Properties > Debugging:
		For 32-bit:
			command: C:\my\Tools\mine\ExplorerBrowser32.exe
			working directory: C:\my\download\
		For 64-bit:
			command: C:\my\Tools\mine\ExplorerBrowser64.exe
			working directory: C:\my\download\

2) Using Windows Explorer - not so good, there are many issues with breaking the program in the debugger, after which the Explorer window becomes inaccessible.
	Explorer: Tools > Folder Options > View:
		[ ] Launch folder windows in a separate process
		- easier to unload the dll due to not having multiple copies of explorer.exe
	Solution > FileRenShell > Properties > Debugging:
		command: C:\Windows\explorer.exe
		command arguments: /select,"C:\my\download\env.txt"
		attach: No
	Explorer: load the FileRenameShell shell extension (right click on a file), the attach the debugger to the corresponding explorer.exe process instance.

HISTORY
=======
1) 4 November 2018: According to Michael Dunn's article:		https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/441/The-Complete-Idiot-s-Guide-to-Writing-Shell-Extens
- This may have an impact on preventing context menu deadlocks in Explorer on Windows 10 (to verify).

Remove OLE Automation features that we don't need (wizard-generated code) from res\FileRenameShell.rgs.
 - The original wizard-generated is backed up at res\FileRenameShell-old (wizard-generated).rgs.
Remove the type library from FileRenShell.rc resources: Resource Includes > Compile-time directives, remove the line:
	1 TYPELIB "FileRenShell.tlb"
Change module server registration in FileRenShell.cpp:
	return g_comModule.RegisterServer( FALSE );			// registers object, NO TYPELIB (read ProjectNotes.txt)
	return g_comModule.UnregisterServer( FALSE );		// NO TYPELIB (read ProjectNotes.txt)

Final registration detail: on NT it's advisable to put our extension in a list of "approved" extensions.
There is a system policy that can be set to prevent extensions from being loaded if they are not on the approved list.
The list is stored in:
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Shell Extensions\Approved

In this key, we create a string value whose name is our GUID. The contents of the string can be anything.
The code to do this goes in our DllRegisterServer() and DllUnregisterServer() functions.
In FileRenShell.cpp:
	AddAsApprovedShellExtension();
	RemoveAsApprovedShellExtension();
